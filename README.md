# Readings-Graphs

### A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph. More formally a Graph can be defined as, A Graph consisting of a finite set of vertices(or nodes) and a set of edges that connect a pair of nodes.

# Types of Graphs:

- Finite Graphs
- Infinite Graph
- Trivial Graph
- Simple Graph
- Multi Graph
- Null Graph
- Complete Graph
- Pseudo Graph
- Regular Graph
- Bipartite Graph
- Labeled Graph
- Digraph Graph
- Subgraph
- Connected or Disconnected Graph
- Cyclic Graph
- Subgraphs

## Vertices

It is basically the number of edges that are available in the shortest path between vertex A and vertex B.If there is more than one edge which is used to connect two vertices then we basically considered the shortest path as the distance between these two vertices.


## Diffrence between graphs and trees

Graph is a non-linear data structure and tree is a non-linear data structure also, graphs is a collection of vertices/nodes and edges where trees is a collection of nodes and edges, for traversals For graph traversal, we use Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Depth-First Search (DFS) while trees traverse using in-order, pre-order, or post-order traversal methods.
